__Introduction__

Hi, my name is Nil Güell Melgar and I'm a student of Biomedical Engineering at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, in Barcelona. My email is nil.guelli01@estudiant.upf.edu. Here I'm gonna present you a work done by Maria Montano about an application of machine learnign algorithms in the localization of the focal area of epileptic seizures. The works title is "_Evaluating signal analysis results with machine learning algorithms: Application to electroencephalogram of epilepsy patients_" and was done in 2017.

Epilepsy is a very common neurological disease which can be described as "excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain"[1]. This disease affects 50 million people worldwide and isn't always an availiable treatment for it. Some of the patients can be treated with anticonvulsive drugs but this type of treatment isn't always successful so the next option is the surgery. This intervention consists of resecting the focal area of the brain that causes the seizures, however, it's not that easy to find. This is where Maria's work enters. By developing a clustering algorithm combining 12 differeent signal analysisi techniques she finds a methon that allows the localization of the epiloptigenetic focus.

You can find the more information about the work in the wiki page.
